Stunenca (Simple Tool Usable for Numerous Extensible Node Composited Applications) (yes, that long of a name for something simple) is a one file library that provides a simple scene graph written in pure Lua. You can find a simple example in `main.lua`, and you can look at `tree.lua` to find rudimentary documentation about every function it provides. WIP, has not been battle-tested that much yet.
You can find other libraries that use this in my Github profile (currently none).
